## What does this software do?

If you have to ask this question, you're probably not the target audience ;)

Jokes aside. Garrett converts the given audio files into the "Waveform Audio File Format" (WAVE) with a static bit depth of 16 bits.
You can choose between two output sample rates: 44100 Hz and 48000 Hz.
The supported input formats are:
- WAVE
- MP3
- FLAC
- AIFF

## Why the hell is this application existing?

The purpose of this originally was to provide a simple conversion interface without needing a lot of knowledge behind the scenes.
The resulting audio files were primarily meant to be played on the x32 console from Behringer. However, this program can be used for other purposes too.
